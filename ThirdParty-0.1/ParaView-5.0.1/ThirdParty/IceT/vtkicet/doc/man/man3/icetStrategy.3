.SH Description

.PP
The \fBIceT \fPAPI comes packaged with several algorithms for compositing 
images. The algorithm to use is determined by selecting a 
\fIstrategy\fP\&.
The strategy is selected with \fBicetStrategy\fP\&.
A 
strategy must be selected before \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
is called. 
.PP
A strategy is chosen from one of the following provided enumerated 
values: 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP
 Basically applies a ``traditional\&'' single tile composition (such as 
binary swap) to each tile in the order they were defined. Because each 
process must take part in the composition of each tile regardless of 
whether they draw into it, this strategy is usually inefficient when 
compositing for more than one tile, but is recommended for the single 
tile case because it bypasses some of the communication necessary for 
the other multi\-tile strategies. 
.igstrategy!sequential
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_DIRECT\fP
 As each process renders an image 
for a tile, that image is sent directly to the process that will 
display that tile. This usually results in a few processes receiving 
and processing the majority of the data, and is therefore usually an 
inefficient strategy. 
.igstrategy!direct
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SPLIT\fP
 Like \fBICET_STRATEGY_DIRECT\fP,
except that the tiles are split up, and each process is assigned a 
piece of a tile in such a way that each process receives and handles 
about the same amount of data. This strategy is often very efficient, 
but due to the large amount of messages passed, it has not proven to be 
very scalable or robust. 
.igstrategy!split
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP
 A two phase algorithm. In the 
first phase, tile images are redistributed such that each process has 
one image for one tile. In the second phase, a ``traditional\&'' single 
tile composition is performed for each tile. Since each process 
contains an image for only one tile, all these compositions may happen 
simultaneously. This is a well rounded strategy that seems to perform 
well in a wide variety of multi\-tile applications. (However, in the 
special case where only one tile is defined, the sequential strategy is 
probably better.) 
.igstrategy!reduce
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_VTREE\fP
 An extension to the binary tree 
algorithm for image composition. Sets up a ``virtual\&'' composition 
tree for each tile image. Processes that belong to multiple trees 
(because they render to more than one tile) are allowed to float 
between trees. This strategy is not quite as well load balanced as 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP
or \fBICET_STRATEGY_SPLIT\fP,
but 
has very well behaved network communication. 
.igstrategy!virtual trees
.PP
Not all of the strategies support ordered image composition. 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP,
\fBICET_STRATEGY_DIRECT\fP,
and 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP
do support ordered image composition. 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SPLIT\fP
and \fBICET_STRATEGY_VTREE\fP
do not 
support ordered image composition and will ignore 
\fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
if it is enabled. 
.PP
Some of the strategies, namely \fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP
and 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP,
use a sub\-strategy that composites the 
image for a single tile. This single image strategy can also be 
specified with \fBicetSingleImageStrategy\fP\&.
