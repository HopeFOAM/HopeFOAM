.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBicetDestroyContext\fP
will happily delete the current context for 
you, but subsequent calls to most other \fBIceT \fPfunctions will probably 
result in seg\-faults unless you make another context current with 
\fBicetCreateContext\fP
or \fBicetSetContext\fP\&.
The most notable 
execptions are the functions with names matching \fBicet*Context\fP,
which will work correctly without a proper current context. 
.PP
.SH Notes

.PP
Behavior is undefined if \fIcontext\fP
has never been created or has 
already been destroyed.
