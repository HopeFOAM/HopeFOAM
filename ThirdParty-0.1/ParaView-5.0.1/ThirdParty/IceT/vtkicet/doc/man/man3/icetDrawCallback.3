.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetDrawCallback\fP
function sets a callback that is used to 
draw the geometry from a given viewpoint. If you are using \fbOpenGL \fP,you 
should probably use the \fBicetGLDrawCallback\fP
function and 
associated \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
These alternative functions 
automatically set up the \fbOpenGL \fPstate and retreive \fbOpenGL \fPbuffers. 
.PP
\fIcallback\fP
should be a function that renders an image of the local 
geometry based on the provided transformation matrices and background 
color. \fBIceT \fPwill call \fIcallback\fP
during a call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP
to create the images for compositing. 
\fIcallback\fP
will be called a minimum amount of times. It may be 
called once. If none of the geometry projects on the display, it may not 
be called at all. If rendering to a tiled display and the geometry 
projects on multiple tiles, it may be called many times. The code in 
\fIcallback\fP
should be prepared to be called an unpredictable amount 
of times. For example, it should not attept to increment a frame counter 
and it should leave the rendering system\&'s state such that another view 
to the geometry may be rendered. 
.PP
\fIcallback\fP
takes two projection matrices: \fIprojection_matrix\fP
and \fImodelview_matrix\fP\&.
Each of these arguments is a 16\-value 
array that represents a $4 *4$ transformation of homogeneous 
coordinates. The arrays store the matrices in 
.igcolumn\-major ordercolumn\-major
order. 
.PP
Note that the \fIprojection_matrix\fP
passed to \fIcallback\fP
is 
liable to be different than that passed to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
Make 
certain that \fIcallback\fP
uses the modified \fIprojection_matrix\fP
passed to it. \fImodelview_matrix\fP
is the same as that passed to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
but also passed along for convienient reference. 
.PP
Any pixel that does not have geometry rendered to it should be set to the 
\fIbackground_color\fP
passed to \fIcallback\fP\&.
Likewise, any 
transparent geometry should be blended against the 
\fIbackground_color\fP\&.
Note that the \fIbackground_color\fP
passed 
to \fIcallback\fP
is liable to be different than that passed to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
.PP
\fIcallback\fP
is given \fIresult\fP,
an image object allocated to the 
size of the physical render size (see \fBicetPhysicalRenderSize\fP).
The dimensions of the image can be queried with \fBicetImageGetWidth\fP
and \fBicetImageGetHeight\fP\&.
Pixels can be put in \fIresult\fP
by 
getting the color and/or depth buffers using the 
\fBicetImageGetColor\fP
and \fBicetImageGetDepth\fP
functions. 
Anything written to these buffers is captured in the image object. 
.PP
\fBIceT \fPpasses \fIcallback\fP
an image sized to the physical render space 
to make indexing into it clearer and safer and to possibly render 
directly into the image buffers. That said, \fBIceT \fPmight only be 
interested in a subregion of the data. To make your callback more 
efficient, \fBIceT \fPprovides \fIreadback_viewport\fP
to specify the region 
of the image it will read. \fIreadback_viewport\fP
has four values. 
The first two values specify the x and y pixel location of the lower left 
corner of the region of interest. The last two values specify the width 
and height of the region of interest. The callback only has to write 
valid pixels for this region of the image. It is not an error to write 
values outside this region, but they will be completely ignored. 
.PP
The \fIcallback\fP
function pointer is placed in the 
\fBICET_DRAW_FUNCTION\fP
state variable.

.SH Notes

.PP
\fIcallback\fP
is tightly coupled with the bounds set with 
\fBicetBoundingVertices\fP
or \fBicetBoundingBox\fP\&.
If the geometry 
drawn by \fIcallback\fP
is dynamic (changes from frame to frame), then the 
bounds may need to be changed as well. Incorrect bounds may cause the 
geometry to be culled in surprising ways.
