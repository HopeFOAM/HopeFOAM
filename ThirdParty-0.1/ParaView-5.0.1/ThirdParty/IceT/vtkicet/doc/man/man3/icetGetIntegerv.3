.SH Description

.PP
Like \fbOpenGL \fP,the operation of \fBIceT \fPis defined by a large state machine. 
Also like \fbOpenGL \fP,the state parameters can be retrieved through the 
\fBicetGet\fP
functions. Each function takes a symbolic constant, 
\fIpname\fP,
which identifies the state parameter to retrieve. They 
also each take an array, \fIparams\fP,
which will be filled with the 
values in \fIpname\fP\&.
It is the calling application\&'s responsibility 
to ensure that \fIparams\fP
is big enough to hold all the data. 
.PP
.SH State Parameters

.PP
The following list identifies valid values for \fIpname\fP
and a 
description of the associated state parameter. 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_BACKGROUND_COLOR\fP
 The color that \fBIceT \fPis currently 
assuming is the background color. It is an RGBA value that is stored 
as four floating point values. This value is set either to the last 
value passed to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
or \fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
the \fbOpenGL \fPbackground color if \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
was called, or 
to black for color blending. (The correct background color is restored 
later.) 
.TP
\fBICET_BACKGROUND_COLOR_WORD\fP
 The same as 
\fBICET_BACKGROUND_COLOR\fP
except that each component is stored as 
8\-bit RGBA values and packed in a 4\-byte integer. The idea is to 
rapidly fill the background of color buffers. 
.TP
\fBICET_BLEND_TIME\fP
 The total time, in seconds, spent in 
performing color blending of images during the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,

Stored as a double. An alias for this value 
is \fBICET_COMPARE_TIME\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_BUFFER_READ_TIME\fP
 The total time, in seconds, spent 
copying buffer data and reading from \fbOpenGL \fPbuffers during the last 
call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
Stored as a double. 
.TP
\fBICET_BUFFER_WRITE_TIME\fP

\fBICET_BYTES_SENT\fP
 The total number of bytes sent by the 
calling process for transferring image data during the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
Stored as an integer. 
.TP
\fBICET_COLLECT_TIME\fP
 The total time spent in collecting 
image fragments to display processes during the last call to

\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_COLOR_FORMAT\fP
 The color format of images to be 
created by the rendering subsystem and composited by \fBIceT \fP\&.Use 
\fBicetSetColorFormat\fP
to set the color format. Use 
\fBicetImageGetColorFormat\fP
to safely get the color format for a 
particular image. 
.TP
\fBICET_COMPARE_TIME\fP
 The total time, in seconds, spent in 
performing Z comparisons of images during the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,

 The composite mode set by 
\fBicetCompositeMode\fP\&.
A single entry stored as an 
IceTEnum\&.
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_ORDER\fP
 The order in which images are to be 
composited if \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is enabled and the 
current strategy supports ordered compositing. The parameter contains 
\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP
entries. The value of this parameter is 
set with \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP\&.
If the element of index i in 
the array is set to j, then there are i images ``on top\&'' of the 
image generated by process j\&. 
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_TIME\fP
 The total time, in seconds, spent in 
compositing during the last call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
Equal to 
$\fBICET_TOTAL_DRAW_TIME\fP
\- \fBICET_RENDER_TIME\fP
\-

\fBICET_DATA_REPLICATION_GROUP\fP
array. 
.TP
\fBICET_DEPTH_FORMAT\fP
 The depth format of images to be 
created by the rendering subsystem and composited by \fBIceT \fP\&.Use 
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP

to safely get the depth format for a 
particular image. 
.TP
\fBICET_DIAGNOSTIC_LEVEL\fP
 The diagnostics flags set with 
\fBicetDiagnostics\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_DISPLAY_NODES\fP

logical display that covers all tile viewports (listed in 
\fBICET_TILE_VIEWPORTS\fP).
The viewport, like an \fbOpenGL \fPviewport, 
is given as the integer four\-tuple $<x, y, width, height 
>$.x and y are placed at the leftmost and lowest position 
of all the tiles, and width and height are just big enough for the 
viewport to cover all tiles. 
.TP

 The target k value used when compositing 
with the radix\-k single image strategy. 
.TP
\fBICET_MAX_IMAGE_SPLIT\fP

 The number of bounding vertices 
listed in the \fBICET_GEOMETRY_BOUNDS\fP
parameter. 
.TP

parallel job as given by the \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
object associated 
with the current context.

or otherwise implicitly to the 
largest tile height specified with \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_WIDTH\fP

or otherwise by explicitly setting it 
with \fBicetPhysicalRenderSize\fP
or otherwise implicitly to the 
largest tile width specified with \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_PROCESS_ORDERS\fP
 Basically, the inverse of 
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_ORDER\fP\&.
The parameter contains 
\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP
entries. If the element of index i in 
the array is set to j, then there are j images ``on top\&'' of the 
image generated by process i\&. 
.TP

\fBIceTCommunicator\fP
object associated with the current context. 
.TP
\fBICET_RENDER_TIME\fP

\fBicetCompositeImage\fP\&.
Stored as a double. 
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY\fP

\fBicetGetSingleImageStrategyName\fP
to get a user\-readable name for 
the single image strategy. 
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY\fP
 The strategy set with 
\fBicetStrategy\fP\&.
Use \fBicetGetStrategyName\fP
to get a 
user\-readable name for the strategy. 
.TP
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SUPPORTS_ORDERING\fP
 Is true if and only if 
the current strategy supports ordered compositing. 
.TP
\fBICET_TILE_DISPLAYED\fP
 The index of the tile the local 
process is displaying. The index will correspond to the tile entry in 
the \fBICET_DISPLAY_NODES\fP
and \fBICET_TILE_VIEWPORTS\fP
arrays. If set to $0 <= i < \fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP$,
then the 
$i^{th}$ entry of \fBICET_DISPLAY_NODES\fP
is equal to 
\fBICET_RANK\fP\&.
If the local process is not displaying any tile, 
then \fBICET_TILE_DISPLAYED\fP
is set to \-1\&. 
.TP
\fBICET_TILE_MAX_HEIGHT\fP

.TP
\fBICET_TILE_MAX_WIDTH\fP

global display defining the tiles. Each viewport is the four\-tuple 
$<x, y, width, height >$defining the position and 
dimensions of a tile in pixels, much like a viewport is defined in 
\fbOpenGL \fP\&.The size of the array is $4 * \fBICET_NUM_TILES\fP$.
The 
viewports are listed in the same order as the tiles were defined with 
\fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_TOTAL_DRAW_TIME\fP
 Time spent in the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
This includes all the time to render, read 
back, compress, and composite images. Stored as a double. 
.TP
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP
 In conjunction with 
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP,
gives the range of valid pixels 
for the last image returned from \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
Given the 
arrays of pixels returned with the \fBicetImageGetColor\fP
and 
\fBicetImageGetDepth\fP
functions, the valid pixels start at the 
pixel indexed by \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP
and continue for 
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP\&.
The tile to which these pixels 
belong are captured in the \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_TILE\fP
state 
variable. If the last call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
did not return 
pixels for the local process, \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP
is set 
to 0\&. This state variable is only useful when 
\fBICET_COLLECT_IMAGES\fP
is off. If on, it can be assumed that 
all display processes contain all pixels in the image 
(\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP
is the number of pixels in the 
image), and all other processes have no pixel data. 
.TP
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP
 In conjunction with 
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP,
gives the range of valid pixels for 
the last image returned from \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
Given the 
arrays of pixels returned with the \fBicetImageGetColor\fP
and 
\fBicetImageGetDepth\fP
functions, the valid pixels start at the 
pixel indexed by \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP
and continue for 
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP\&.
The tile to which these pixels 
belong are captured in the \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_TILE\fP
state 
variable. This state variable is only useful when 
\fBICET_COLLECT_IMAGES\fP
is off. If on, it can be assumed that 
all display processes contain all pixels in the image 
(\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP
is 0), and all other processes 
have no pixel data. 
.TP
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_TILE\fP
 Gives the tile for which the 
last image returned from \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
contains pixels. 
Each process has its own value. If the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP,
or 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP
did not return pixels for the local process, 
then this state variable is set to \-1\&. This state variable is only 
useful when \fBICET_COLLECT_IMAGES\fP
is off. If on, it can be 
assumed that all display processes have valid pixels for their 
respective display tiles, and all other processes have no pixel data. 
.PP
In addition, if you are using the \fbOpenGL \fPlayer (i.e., have called 
\fBicetGLInitialize\fP),
these variables, defined in IceTGL.h,
are also available. 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DRAW_FUNCTION\fP
 A pointer to the \fbOpenGL \fPdrawing 
callback function, as set by \fBicetGLDrawCallback\fP\&.
.TP
\fBICET_GL_READ_BUFFER\fP
 The \fbOpenGL \fPbuffer to read from 
(and write to). Set with \fBicetGLSetReadBuffer\fP\&.
