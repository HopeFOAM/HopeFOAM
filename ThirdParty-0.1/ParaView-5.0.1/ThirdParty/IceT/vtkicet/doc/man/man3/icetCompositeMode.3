.SH Description

.PP
Sets the composite mode used when combining images. \fBIceT \fPenables 
parallel rendering by allowing each process in your code to independently 
render images of partial geometry. These partial\-geometry images are 
then ``composited\&'' to form a single image equivalent to if all the 
geometry were rendered by a single process. 
.PP
\fBIceT \fPsupports multiple operations that can be used to combine images. 
The operator you use should be equivalent to that used by your rendering 
system to resolve .ighidden surfacehidden
surfaces or mix occluding 
geometry with that behind it. 
.PP
The argument \fImode\fP
is one of the following enumerations: 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_Z_BUFFER\fP
 Use the 
.igz\-bufferz\-buffer
hidden\-surface removal operation. The 
compositing operation compares the distance of pixel fragments from the 
viewpoint and passes the fragment closest to the user. In order for 
this operation to work, images must have a depth buffer (set with 
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP).
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP
 Blend two fragments together 
using the standard 
.igover operator.igunder operatorover/under
operator. in 
order for this operation to work, images must have a color buffer (set 
with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fP)that has an alpha channel and there must be 
\fIno\fP
depth buffer (as the operation makes no sense with depth). 
Also, this mode will only work if \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is 
enabled and the order is set with \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP\&.
.PP
The default compositing mode is 
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_Z_BUFFER\fP\&.
The current composite mode is 
stored in the \fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE\fP
state variable.

\fBICET_INVALID_ENUM\fP
 \fImode\fP
is not a valid composite mode.

.SH Warnings

None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBicetCompositeMode\fP
will let you set a mode even if it is 
incompatible with other current settings. Some settings will be checked 
during a call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
or \fBicetCompositeImage\fP\&.
For example, if the image format (specified with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand 
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP)does not support the composite mode picked, you will 
get an error during the call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
.PP
Other incompatibilities are also not checked. For example, if the 
composite mode is set to \fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP,
\fBIceT \fPwill 
happily use this operator even if \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is not 
enabled. However, because order matters in the blend mode, you will 
probably get incorrect images if the compositing happens in arbitrary 
order.
