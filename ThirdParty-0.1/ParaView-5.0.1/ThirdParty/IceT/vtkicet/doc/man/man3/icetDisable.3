.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetEnable\fPand \fBicetDisable\fPfunctions turn various \fBIceT \fPfeatures on 
and off. \fIpname\fP
is a symbolic constant representing the feature to 
be turned on or off. Valid values for \fIpname\fP
are: 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_COLLECT_IMAGES\fP
 When this option is on (the default) 
images partitions are always collected to display processes. When this 
option is turned off, the strategy has the option of leaving images 
partitioned among processes. Each process containing part of a tile\&'s 
image will return the entire buffer from \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP,
or \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
in an 
\fBIceTImage\fP
object. However, only certain pixels will be valid. 
The state variables \fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_TILE\fP,
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_OFFSET\fP,
and 
\fBICET_VALID_PIXELS_NUM\fP
give which tile the pixels belong to 
and what range of pixels are valid. 
.TP
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_ONE_BUFFER\fP
 Turn this option on when 
performing z\-buffer compositing of a color image and the only result 
you need is the color image itself (not the depth buffer). This is 
common if you are just creating an image and are not interested in 
doing depth queries. This option is on by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_CORRECT_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 Colored backgrounds are 
problematic when performing color blended compositing in that the 
background color will be additively blended from each image. Enabling 
this flag will internally cause the color to be reset to black and then 
cause the color to be blended back into the resulting images. This 
flag is disabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT\fP
 .igfloating viewport
If 
enabled, the projection will be shifted such that the geometry will be 
rendered in one shot whenever possible, even if the geometry straddles 
up to four tiles. This flag is enabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_INTERLACE_IMAGES\fP
 If enabled, pixels in images 
(might be) shuffled to better load balance the compositing work. This 
flag is enabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
 If enabled, the image composition 
will be performed in the order specified by the last call to 
\fBicetCompositeOrder\fP,
assuming the current strategy (specified by 
a call to \fBicetStrategy\fP)
supports ordered composition. 
Generally, you want to enable ordered compositing if doing color 
blending and disable if you are doing z\-buffer comparisons. If 
enabled, you should call \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP
between each frame 
to update the image order as camera angles change. This flag is 
disabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_RENDER_EMPTY_IMAGES\fP
 If disabled, \fBIceT \fPwill never 
invoke the drawing callback.igdrawing callback
if all geometry is 
outside the clipping planes of the current projection. If enabled, 
\fBIceT \fPwill still invoke the drawing callback \fIif\fP
the compositing 
strategy has requested the tile. However, most compositing strategies 
do not request images for all tiles. The floating viewport can also 
consolidate up to four renderings into one. To ensure that the drawing 
callback is invoked for all tiles on all processes, enable 
\fBICET_RENDER_EMPTY_IMAGES\fP,
disable 
\fBICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT\fP,
and set the strategy (using 
\fBicetStrategy\fP)
to \fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP\&.
This flag 
is disabled by default. 
.PP
In addition, if you are using the \fbOpenGL \fPlayer (i.e., have called 
\fBicetGLInitialize\fP),
these options, defined in IceTGL.h,
are also available. 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
 If enabled, the final, composited image 
for each tile is written back to the frame buffer before the return of 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
This flag is enabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 If this and 
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled, \fBIceT \fPuses \fbOpenGL \fPblending to 
ensure that all background is set to the correct color. This flag is 
disabled by default. This option does not affect the images returned 
from \fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP;
it only affects the image in the \fbOpenGL \fP
color buffer. 
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
 If this and 
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled and the renderable window is 
larger than the displayed tile (as determined by the current \fbOpenGL \fP
viewport), then resample the image to fit within the renderable window 
before writing back to frame buffer. This flag is disabled by default. 
This option does not affect the images returned from 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP;
it only affects the image in the \fbOpenGL \fPcolor 
buffer. If this option is not enabled, then images are written at 
their natural size in the lower left corner of the window. 
.TP
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE_WITH_HARDWARE\fP
 This option 
determines how images are inflated. When enabled (the default), images 
are inflated by creating a texture and allowing the hardware to inflate 
the image. When disabled, images are inflated on the CPU. This option 
has no effect unless both \fBICET_GL_DISPLAY\fP
and 
\fBICET_GL_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
are also enabled.

is not a feature 
to be enabled or disabled.

.SH Warnings

.PP
None.

.SH Bugs

.PP
The check for a valid \fIpname\fP
is not thorough, and thus the 
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
error may not always be raised.
