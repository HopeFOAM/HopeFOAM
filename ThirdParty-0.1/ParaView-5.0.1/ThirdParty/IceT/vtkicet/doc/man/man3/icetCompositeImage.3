.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
function takes image buffer data and 
composites it to a single image. This function behaves similarly to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP
except that instead of using callback functions to 
render and retrieve image data, the images are pre\-rendered and passed 
directly to \fBicetCompositeImage\fP\&.
Although it is more efficient to 
allow \fBIceT \fPto determine rendering projections and use callbacks, it is 
often more convenient for applications to integrate \fBIceT \fPas a separate 
compositing step after the rendering. 
.PP
Before \fBIceT \fPmay composite an image, the display needs to be defined 
(using \fBicetAddTile\fP),
the buffer formats need to be specified 
(using \fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand \fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP),and the composite 
strategy must be set (using \fBicetStrategy\fP).
The single image 
sub\-strategy may also optionally be set (using 
\fBicetSingleImageStrategy\fP).
.PP
All process must call \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
for the operation to 
complete on any process in a parallel job. 
.PP
The \fIcolor_buffer\fP
and \fIdepth_buffer\fP
arguments point to 
memory buffers that contain the image data. The image data is always 
stored in densely packed arrays in row\-major order (a.k.a. x\-major order 
or by scan\-lines). The first horizontal scan\-line is at the bottom of the 
image with subsequent scan\-lines moving up. The size of each image buffer 
is expected to be the width and the height of the global viewport (which 
is set indirectly with \fBicetAddTile\fP).
The global viewport is 
stored in the \fBICET_GLOBAL_VIEWPORT\fP
state variable. If only one 
tile is specified, then the width and height of the global viewport will 
be the same as this one tile. 
.PP
The format for \fIcolor_buffer\fP
is expected to be the same as what is 
set with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fP\&.The following formats and their 
interpretations with respect to \fIcolor_buffer\fP
are as follows. 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_IMAGE_COLOR_RGBA_UBYTE\fP
 Each entry is an RGBA 
color tuple. Each component is valued in the range from 0 to 255 
and is stored as an 8\-bit integer. The buffer will always be allocated 
on memory boundaries such that each color value can be treated as a 
single 32\-bit integer. 
.TP
\fBICET_IMAGE_COLOR_RGBA_FLOAT\fP
 Each entry is an RGBA 
color tuple. Each component is in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 and is 
stored as a 32\-bit float. 
.TP
\fBICET_IMAGE_COLOR_NONE\fP
 No color values are stored in the 
image. 
.PP
Likewise, the format for \fIdepth_buffer\fP
is expected to be the same 
as what is set with \fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP\&.The following formats and 
their interpretations with respect to \fIdepth_buffer\fP
are as 
follows. 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_IMAGE_DEPTH_FLOAT\fP
 Each entry is in the range from 
0.0 (near plane) to 1.0 (far plane) and is stored as a 32\-bit 
float. 
.TP
\fBICET_IMAGE_DEPTH_NONE\fP
 No depth values are stored in the 
image. 
.PP
If the current format does not have a color or depth, then the respective 
buffer argument should be set to NULL\&.
.PP
Care should be taken to make sure that the color and depth buffer formats 
are consistent to the formats expected by \fBIceT \fP\&.Mismatched formats will 
result in garbage images and possible memory faults. 
.PP
Also note that when compositing with color blending 
(\fBicetCompositeMode\fP
is set to 
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP),
the color buffer must be rendered 
with a black background in order for the composite to complete 
correctly. A colored background can later be added using the 
\fIbackground_color\fP
as described below. 
.PP
\fIvalid_pixels_viewport\fP
is an optional argument that makes it 
possible to specify a subset of pixels that are valid. In parallel 
rendering it is common for a single process to render geometry in only a 
small portion of the image, and \fBIceT \fPcan take advantage of this 
information. If the rendering system identifies such a region, it can be 
specified with \fIvalid_pixels_viewport\fP\&.
.PP
Like all viewports in \fBIceT \fP,\fIvalid_pixels_viewport\fP
is an array 
of 4 integers in the form $<x, y, width, height >$.This 
viewport is given in relation to the image passed in the 
\fIcolor_buffer\fP
and \fIdepth_buffer\fP
arguments. Everything 
outside of this rectangular region will be ignored. For example, if the 
\fIvalid_pixels_viewport\fP
$<10, 20, 150, 100 >$is 
given, then \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
will ignore all pixels in the 
bottom 10 rows, the left 20 columns, anything above the 
$160^th$
(10+150) row, and anything to the right of the 
$120^th$
(20+100) column. 
.PP
If \fIvalid_pixels_viewport\fP
is NULL,
then all pixels in the 
input image are assumed to be valid. 
.PP
\fIprojection_matrix\fP
and \fImodelview_matrix\fP
are optional 
arguments that specify the projection that was used during rendering. 
When applied to the geometry bounds information given with 
\fBicetBoundingBox\fP
or \fBicetBoundingVertices\fP,
this provides 
\fBIceT \fPwith further information on local image projections. If the given 
matrices are not the same used in the rendering or the given bounds do 
not contain the geometry, \fBIceT \fPmay clip the geometry in surprising ways. 
If these arguments are set to NULL,
then geometry projection will 
not be considered when determining what parts of images are valid. 
.PP
The \fIbackground_color\fP
argument specifies the desired background 
color for the image. It is given as an array of 4 floating point values 
specifying, in order, the red, green, blue, and alpha channels of the 
color in the range from 0.0 to 1.0\&. 
.PP
When rendering using a depth buffer, the background color is used to fill 
in empty regions of images. When rendering using color blending, the 
background color is used to correct colored backgrounds. 
.PP
As stated previously, color blended compositing only works correctly if 
the images are rendered with a clear black background. Otherwise the 
background color will be added multiple times by each process that 
contains geometry in that pixel. If the 
\fBICET_CORRECT_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
feature is enabled, this 
background color is blended back into the final composited image. 
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
On each .igdisplay processdisplay
process (as defined by 
\fBicetAddTile\fP),
\fBicetCompositeImage\fP
returns the fully 
composited image in an \fBIceTImage\fP
object. The contents of the 
image are undefined for any non\-display process. 
.PP
If the \fBICET_COMPOSITE_ONE_BUFFER\fP
option is on and both a color 
and depth buffer is specified with \fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand 
\fBicetSetDepthFormat\fP,then the returned image might be missing the depth 
buffer. The rational behind this option is that often both the color and 
depth buffer is necessary in order to composite the color buffer, but the 
composited depth buffer is not needed. In this case, the compositing 
might save some time by not transferring depth information at the latter 
stage of compositing. 
.PP
The returned image uses memory buffers that will be reclaimed the next 
time \fBIceT \fPrenders or composites a frame. Do not use this image after 
the next call to \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
(unless you have changed the 
\fBIceT \fPcontext). 
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 An argument is set to NULL
where data is required. 
.TP
\fBICET_OUT_OF_MEMORY\fP
 Not enough memory left to hold intermittent frame buffers and other 
temporary data. 
.PP
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP
may also indirectly raise an error if there is an 
issue with the strategy or callback. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 An argument to \fBicetCompositeImage\fP
is inconsistent with the 
current \fBIceT \fPstate. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
The images provided must match the format expected by \fBIceT \fPor else 
unpredictable behavior may occur. The images must also be carefully 
rendered to follow the provided viewport and projections. Images that a 
color blended must be rendered with a black background and rendered with 
the correct alpha value. 
.PP
If compositing with color blending on, the image returned may have a 
black background instead of the \fIbackground_color\fP
requested. This 
can be corrected by blending the returned image over the desired 
background. This will be done for you if the 
\fBICET_CORRECT_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
feature is enabled.
