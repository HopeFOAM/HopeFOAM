.SH Description

.PP
Specify the size of images that are rendered with 
\fBicetPhysicalRenderSize\fP\&.
This is the size of image that is 
expected to be rendered by the draw callback (specified with 
\fBicetDrawCallback\fP).
The width and height are captured in the 
\fBICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_WIDTH\fP
and 
\fBICET_PHYSICAL_RENDER_HEIGHT\fP
state variables. 
.PP
The size of images that are rendered do not have to be the same size as 
the tile they are rendering so long as they are not smaller in any 
dimension. In fact, when rendering multiple tiles it can often save time 
to render larger images. Nevertheless, by default the physical render 
size is set to the size of the tiles in \fBicetAddTile\fP
because this 
is the most common use case. 
.PP
When using the \fbOpenGL \fPrendering layer, the physical rendering size is 
overridden to the size of the \fbOpenGL \fPviewport in each call to 
\fBicetGLDrawFrame\fP\&.
