.SH Description

.PP
Images are created internally by the \fBIceT \fPlibrary. Sometimes it is 
convenient to have a placeholder for a .igimage!null``null\&''
image, 
an image that does not and cannot hold data. Null images require no 
allocated memory to function. 
.PP
If your code has the potential of using an \fBIceTImage\fP
image object 
that might not otherwise be initialized, use \fBicetImageNull\fP
to set 
it to a null object. This will ensure that \fBIceT \fPimage functions that 
operate on it will behave deterministically. 
.PP
A null image simply looks like an image with no pixels and has no color 
buffers. \fBicetImageGetWidth\fP,
\fBicetImageGetHeight\fP,
and 
\fBicetImageGetNumPixels\fP
all return 0 for a null image. 
\fBicetSetColorFormat\fPand \fBicetSetDepthFormat\fPreturn 
\fBICET_IMAGE_COLOR_NONE\fP
and \fBICET_IMAGE_DEPTH_NONE\fP,
respectively. 
.PP
You can identify a null image with the \fBicetImageIsNull\fP
function.
