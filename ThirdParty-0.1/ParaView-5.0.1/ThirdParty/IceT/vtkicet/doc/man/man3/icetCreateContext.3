.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetCreateContext\fP
function creates a new 
.igcontext!\fBIceT \fP\fBIceT \fP
context, makes it current, and returns a 
handle to the new context. The handle returned is of type 
\fBIceTContext\fP\&.
This is an opaque type that should not be handled 
directly, but rather simply passed to other \fBIceT \fPfunctions. 
.PP
Like \fbOpenGL \fP,the \fBIceT \fPengine behaves like a large state machine. The 
parameters for engine operation is held in the current state. The entire 
state is encapsulated in a context. Each new context contains its own 
state. 
.PP
It is therefore possible to change the entire current state of \fBIceT \fPby 
simply switching contexts. Switching contexts is much faster, and often 
more convenient, than trying to change many state parameters.

.SH Bugs

.PP
It may be tempting to use contexts to run different \fBIceT \fPoperations on 
separate program threads. Although certainly possible, great care must 
be taken. First of all, all threads will share the same context. Second 
of all, \fBIceT \fPis not thread safe. Therefore, a multi\-threaded program 
would have to run all \fBIceT \fPcommands in `critical sections\&' to ensure 
that the correct context is being used, and the methods execute safely in 
general. 
.PP
.SH Notes

.PP
\fBicetCreateContext\fP
duplicates the communicator \fIcomm\fP\&.
Thus, 
to avoid deadlocks on certain implementations (such as MPI), the user 
level program should call \fBicetCreateContext\fP
on all processes with 
the same \fIcomm\fP
object at about the same time.
