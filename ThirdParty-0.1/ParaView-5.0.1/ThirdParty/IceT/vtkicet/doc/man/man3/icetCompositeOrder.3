\fBicetCompositeOrder \-\- specify the order in which images are composited\fP

#include <IceT.h>
.PP
void \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP(
const IceTInt *
\fIprocess_ranks\fP
);
.PP
.SH Description

.PP
If \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
is enabled and the current strategy 
supports ordered composition (verified with the 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_SUPPORTS_ORDERING\fP
state variable, then the order 
which images are composited is specified with \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP\&.
If compositing is done with z\-buffer comparisons 
(e.g. \fBicetCompositeMode\fP
is called with 
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_Z_BUFFER\fP),
then the ordering does not 
matter, and \fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
should probably be disabled. 
However, if compositing is done with color blending 
(e.g. \fBicetCompositeMode\fP
is called with 
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_MODE_BLEND\fP),
then the order in which the images 
are composed can drastically change the output. 
.PP
For ordered image compositing to work, the geometric objects rendered by 
processes must be arranged such that if the geometry of one process is 
``in front\&'' of the geometry of another process for any camera ray, that 
ordering holds for all camera rays. It is the application\&'s 
responsibility to ensure that such an ordering exists and to find that 
ordering. The easiest way to do this is to ensure that the geometry of 
each process falls cleanly into regions of a grid, octree, k\-d tree, or 
similar structure. 
.PP
Once the geometry order is determined for a particular rendering 
viewpoint, it is given to \fBIceT \fPin the form of an array of ranks. The 
parameter \fIprocess_ranks\fP
should have exactly 
\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP
entries, each with a unique, valid process 
rank. The first process should have the geometry that is ``in front\&'' of 
all others, the next directly behind that, and so on. It should be noted 
that the application may actually impose only a partial order on the 
geometry, but that can easily be converted to the linear ordering required 
by \fBIceT \fP\&.
.PP
When ordering is on, it is accepted that \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP
will 
be called in between every frame since the order of the geometry may 
change with the viewpoint. 
.PP
If data replication is in effect (see \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP),
all processes are still expected to be listed in \fIprocess_ranks\fP\&.
Correct ordering can be achieved by ensuring that all processes in each 
group are listed in contiguous entries in \fIprocess_ranks\fP\&.

.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 Not every entry in the parameter \fIprocess_ranks\fP
was a unique, 
valid process rank. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
If an \fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
error is raised, internal arrays 
pertaining to the ordering of images may not be restored properly. If 
such an error is raised, the function should be re\-invoked with a valid 
ordering before preceding. Unpredictable results may occur otherwise.
