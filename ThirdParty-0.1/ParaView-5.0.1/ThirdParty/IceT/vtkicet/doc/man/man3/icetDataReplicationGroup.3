.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPhas the ability to take advantage of geometric data that is 
replicated among processes. If a group of processes share the same 
geometry data, then \fBIceT \fPwill split the region of the display that the 
data projects onto among the processes, thereby reducing the total amount 
of image composition work that needs to be done. 
.PP
Each group can be declared by calling \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
and defining the group of processes that share the geometry with the 
local process. \fIsize\fP
indicates how many processes belong to the 
group, and \fIprocesses\fP
is an array of ids of processes that belong 
to the group. Each process that belongs to a particular group must call 
\fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
with the exact same list of processes in 
the same order. 
.PP
You can alternately use \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
to select 
data replication groups. 
.PP
By default, each process belongs to a group of size one containing just 
the local processes (i.e. there is no data replication).

None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBIceT \fPassumes that \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
is called with the 
exact same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. 
Likewise, \fBIceT \fPalso assumes that all processes have called 
\fBicetBoundingVertices\fP
or \fBicetBoundingBox\fP
with the exact 
same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. These 
requirements are not strictly enforced, but failing to do so may cause 
some of the geometry to not be rendered.
